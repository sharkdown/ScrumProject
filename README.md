Agile software methods are the same in essence in itself, but they are divided into various sub-branches that differ in their processes. One of the most popular of these is Scrum. Scrum is the name given to the small teams created in the rugby game as a word. This method was established in the 90's, and the day-to-day progress has been continuous.

Scrum is an administrative model with very simple rules at first glance. The requirements are applied to the management of complex, open software projects that are not explicitly defined. Scrum does not specify the steps to be followed in the project in detail, but instead offers flexible management with a few simple but important rules.

The most important output process that Scrum is presenting is the transparent process of disruption in the process. Scrum thus motivates the project team to continually improve by resolving emerging disruptions.
